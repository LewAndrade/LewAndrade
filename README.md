## What I Build  
I design and scale full-stack systems and developer platforms that power products used by millions of people.  
My work spans backend APIs, front-end frameworks, developer experience, observability, and reliability at scale.  
I love building tools and architectures that make other engineers faster.

## Recent Highlights  
- 🧩 Led the rollout of a **Server-Driven UI Template Framework**, adopted company-wide — reduced duplicate code by 40% and accelerated delivery.  
- ⚙️ Built a **Dynamic Screen Rendering Engine** for onboarding and KYC flows, cutting delivery time from months to hours and enabling international expansion.  
- 🔍 Drove **operational excellence** through SLOs/SLAs, improved observability, refined on-call practices, and mentored engineers on system design and developer experience.

## Tech Stack  
Clojure · TypeScript · Python · Go · C  
AWS · Kubernetes · Docker · Kafka

*Always playing with some new stuff.*

## Currently Learning  
Systems-level programming in Go and C, experimenting with high-performance backend services, and building tiny side projects for fun and learning.

## Outside of Work  
When I’m not deep in code, I’m usually playing soccer, building indie games, or discovering new music.  
Sometimes I write about engineering culture and architecture experiments.
