## What I build  
I design and ship full-stack systems and developer platforms that serve millions of users. My work spans backend APIs, front-end frameworks, developer tooling, observability and reliability at scale.

## Recent Highlights  
- Led the rollout of a **Server-Driven UI Template Framework**, adopted across multiple business units and reducing duplicate code by 40%.  
- Built a **Dynamic Screen Rendering Engine** for onboarding/KYC flows, cutting delivery time from months to hours and enabling international expansion.  
- Championed operational excellence: defined SLOs/SLAs, improved incident & on-call practices, and mentored engineers in system design and developer experience.

## Tech Stack  
Clojure · TypeScript · Python · Go · C · AWS · Kubernetes · Docker · Kafka · DynamoDB · PostgreSQL  
*Constantly exploring new architecture and developer tooling.*

## Currently Learning  
Systems-level programming with Go and C, and experimenting with high-performance backend services and observability architectures.

## Outside of Work  
When I’m not coding you’ll find me playing soccer, building indie games or discovering new music.
